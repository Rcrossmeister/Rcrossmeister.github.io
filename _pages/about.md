# 👋 About Me
Hi, I am Zijin Hong, currently a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a dual bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with Mathematics at Jinan University (JNU) and the University of Birmingham (UoB). I'm supervised by Prof. [Feiran Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=of1vcxsAAAAJ&hl) in JNU and work closely with Prof. [Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/) and Dr. [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7oeLWT0AAAAJ&hl) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).

My current research interests include **large language models and their applications**, **information extraction**, and **code (SQL) generation**. During my free time, I enjoy customizing mechanical keyboards and playing video games. Please feel free to reach me out!
